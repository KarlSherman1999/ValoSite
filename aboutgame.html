        <p>Valorant has many different gamemodes but the most common is unrated and competive. There are shorter modes if you run short on time, such as spike rush and maybe even deathmatch, if you feel the need to practice your headshots before grinding in ranked! </p>

        <h2>Unrated / Competitive</h2>
        <p> Valorants most popular gamemodes unrated and competitive put you in a 5v5 bomb plant / defuse scenario. You will select an agent, all with their signature abilities. It can last up to 25 rounds and the first team to 13 rounds won wins the game. As the attackers you will aim to plant the spike at one of the specified sites and hold this site so that the defenders cannot defuse it. Defenders are there to protect the bomb sites and aim to defuse the bomb if it gets planted.</p>

        <h2>Spike Rush</h2>
        <p>Spike rush is similar to unrated and comp however, its a lot shorter and everyone gets random weapons each round and there are also random powerups placed around the map. In spike rush its the first team to 4 points that comes out as the victor.</p>

        <h2>Deathmatch</h2>
        <p>Its exactly as the name says, you try to get as many kills as possible and the first player to kill 40 opponents wins. A very good gamemode to use if you need to warmup before a competitive game.</p>
